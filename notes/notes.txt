//I do programming for a living. Its not a glamorous job but it does pay the bills. In order to prove to one self that you 
are a true programmer, you must receive the acknowledgment and consideration from your peers. There are tremendous coders out 
there that can defeat me in any test.

//You must learn to master technologies. The first step is to read about the technologies. Know the ins and outs of the working.
As for today I need to add the feature to add a database connection to an API. When you make a call to an API, you need only credentials 
(username, password). Then to make sure the endpoints are correctly called. All of programming follow these steps: reading, theoretical notions,
program, debug. thats it. each part requires training. extreme training. read,think,code,debug is in a nutshell what my job is all about. technologies
stack: Express,sequelize,pg.

//The landscape of technology changes rapidly. One must focus on the quality of knowledge then the quantity. In the end, it truly is the man versus the machine.
In the old days, cowboys broke stallions; now they break machines. 

//I have seen real legends who do programming for living. They understand the software as they made it. Coders are driven creatures that like to
break things and gain wisdom after breaking code. They are good at multi-tasking. There is a sense of appreciation for the code itself. 

//There are days that will be yours. There be days that be against you. Like the tides of ocean, the days change from one to another. The mind or the 
ship steering wheel must remain intact. It cant be timid, pestured, weakened or intoxicated. It has to be ever-present. Ready to execute. Ready to explode.


//ORM is good. It allows to map objects to data records. I am experimenting with
making sample tables and perform crud operation. 

//The day you find yourself. You truly understand who you are then you can 
//do anything kid. You can move mountains, dig gold and make the world better.
//bsc you know yourself. 

//The wild cowboyz ride through the storm. We are on the iron horses that
//glide through the open fields like a red velvet carpet sprawled in the 
//sitting area.

//I always look at the fundamentals. What is the essence of the object?
//then only you can start to critique. There is an iceberg laying solemn 
//in my chest.

//each programmar starts off as a video gamer. that is the 
//fundamental. Games are fundamental to creativty and thinking.
//game allows one to see how the code works.

//the hardest part of coding is thinking in terms of alogorithms.
//it is pure science. It is pure logic and systematic. It is hard.
//that is why I get paid for. to lift the heavy load and change the 
//world.

//What is America? Kapital.



//crud 101:
- setup the server
- setup the db
- connect to db
- make a table
- insert data in db
- make logic
- make routes
- test it!!

//task:
- make a post data request to save data in db
- 


JS has concepts that are unique to the language:

//what is the fundamental components of a language:
//There is the variables, type system ...
