//I do programming for a living. Its not a glamorous job but it does pay the bills. In order to prove to one self that you 
are a true programmer, you must receive the acknowledgment and consideration from your peers. There are tremendous coders out 
there that can defeat me in any test.

//You must learn to master technologies. The first step is to read about the technologies. Know the ins and outs of the working.
As for today I need to add the feature to add a database connection to an API. When you make a call to an API, you need only credentials 
(username, password). Then to make sure the endpoints are correctly called. All of programming follow these steps: reading, theoretical notions,
program, debug. thats it. each part requires training. extreme training. read,think,code,debug is in a nutshell what my job is all about. 

//I have seen real legends who do programming for living. They understand the software as they made it. Coders are driven creatures that like to
break things and gain wisdom after breaking code. They are good at multi-tasking. There is a sense of appreciation for the code itself.
